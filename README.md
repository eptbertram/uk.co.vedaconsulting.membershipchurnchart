## How it works

During installation the extension will create a new scheduled job 'Membership Churn Chart - Prepare Data' which prepares the churn chart data.
The extension will also create 2 database tables to prepare and consolidate churn chart data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `civicrm_membership_churn_table` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'Unique Id',
  `year` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `month` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `membership_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `membership_type_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `current` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `joined` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `resigned` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `rejoined` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `civicrm_membership_churn_monthly_table` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'Unique Id',
  `month_year` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `year` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `month` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `membership_type_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `current` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `joined` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `resigned` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `rejoined` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `brought_forward` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `churn` double(10, 2) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
```

* 'civicrm_membership_churn_table' table is used to store the status (Joined/Current/Resigned/Rejoined) of each membership records for each month/year.
* 'civicrm_membership_churn_monthly_table' table is used to consolidate the membership records grouped by membership type/year/month, which is used to render the chart.

### Statuses (For the month):
* Brought forward = (Joined + Rejoined + Current) - Resigned, from the previous month
* Joined = Member joined in that month
* Current = Membership is current in that month
* Resigned = Membership ended in that month
* Rejoined = Member rejoined in that month (The member has a expired membership record & a new membership record was created of the same membership type)
* Churn = (Joined + Rejoined - Resigned) / BroughtForward
